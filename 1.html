<p>Ethics of artificial intelligence. ... It is typically divided into roboethics,
a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, construct, use and
treat artificially intelligent beings, and machine ethics, which is concerned
with the moral behavior of artificial moral agents (AMAs).</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">The term "robot ethics" (sometimes "roboethics")
refers to the morality of how humans design, construct, use and treat robots and
 other artificially intelligent beings.[1] It considers both how artificially
 intelligent beings may be used to harm humans and how they may be used to benefit
 humans.</p>
